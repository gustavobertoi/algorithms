# Algorithms

## About

This repository is used to store code for complex algorithms that I will probably never use in my life, unless some reasons:

1. Join into big-tech company;
2. Learn something new to applicate in a real project;

Yes, I know this sounds a little arrogant, but that's how it should sound, most of the time, I won't need to know most of these algorithms, but there are always exceptions or cases thats needs.

### Why do I say that?

Because most of the time, we solve simple problems that don't require ultra complex algorithms, but there can always be moments where I or even you should know.

## Languages & Tools

I will use typescript + jest to solve the algorithms, in the future I intend to extend it to other languages as ​​

- Elixir
- Go lang
- Rust

# Stupid Algorithms

## About

This repository is used to store code for complex algorithms that I will probably never use in my life, unless I want to get into big-tech company and earn a good salary, or I want to learn something new.

Yes, I know this sounds a little arrogant, but that's how it should sound, most of the time, I won't need to know most of these algorithms, but there are always exceptions or cases thats needs.

## Languages & Tools

I will use typescript + jest to solve the algorithms, in the future I intend to extend it to other languages as ​​(elixir maybe).

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/)
